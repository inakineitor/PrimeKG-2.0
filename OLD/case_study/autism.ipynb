It affects how a person acts and interacts with others, communicates, and learns. It includes what used to be known as Asperger syndrome and pervasive developmental disorders. It is called a \"spectrum\" disorder because people with asd can have a range of symptoms. People with asd might have problems talking with you, or they might not look you in the eye when you talk to them. They may also have restricted interests and repetitive behaviors. They may spend a lot of time putting things in order, or they may say the same sentence again and again. They may often seem to be in their \"own world.\" At well-child checkups, the health care provider should check your child\\'s development. If there are signs of asd, your child will have a comprehensive evaluation. It may include a team of specialists, doing various tests and evaluations to make a diagnosis. The causes of asd are not known. Research suggests that both genes and environment play important roles. There is currently no one standard treatment for asd. There are many ways to increase your child\\'s ability to grow and learn new skills. Starting them early can lead to better results. Treatments include behavior and communication therapies, skills training, and medicines to control symptoms. NIH: National Institute of Child Health and Human Development'\n",

      "mayo_symptoms [\"Some children show signs of autism spectrum disorder in early infancy, such as reduced eye contact, lack of response to their name or indifference to caregivers. Other children may develop normally for the first few months or years of life, but then suddenly become withdrawn or aggressive or lose language skills they've already acquired. Signs usually are seen by age 2 years. Each child with autism spectrum disorder is likely to have a unique pattern of behavior and level of severity — from low functioning to high functioning. Some children with autism spectrum disorder have difficulty learning, and some have signs of lower than normal intelligence. Other children with the disorder have normal to high intelligence — they learn quickly, yet have trouble communicating and applying what they know in everyday life and adjusting to social situations. Because of the unique mixture of symptoms in each child, severity can sometimes be difficult to determine. It's generally based on the level of impairments and how they impact the ability to function. Below are some common signs shown by people who have autism spectrum disorder. Social communication and interaction, A child or adult with autism spectrum disorder may have problems with social interaction and communication skills, including any of these signs: Fails to respond to his or her name or appears not to hear you at times, Resists cuddling and holding, and seems to prefer playing alone, retreating into his or her own world, Has poor eye contact and lacks facial expression, Doesn't speak or has delayed speech, or loses previous ability to say words or sentences, Can't start a conversation or keep one going, or only starts one to make requests or label items, Speaks with an abnormal tone or rhythm and may use a singsong voice or robot-like speech, Repeats words or phrases verbatim, but doesn't understand how to use them, Doesn't appear to understand simple questions or directions, Doesn't express emotions or feelings and appears unaware of others' feelings, Doesn't point at or bring objects to share interest, Inappropriately approaches a social interaction by being passive, aggressive or disruptive, Has difficulty recognizing nonverbal cues, such as interpreting other people's facial expressions, body postures or tone of voice, Patterns of behavior, A child or adult with autism spectrum disorder may have limited, repetitive patterns of behavior, interests or activities, including any of these signs: Performs repetitive movements, such as rocking, spinning or hand flapping, Performs activities that could cause self-harm, such as biting or head-banging, Develops specific routines or rituals and becomes disturbed at the slightest change, Has problems with coordination or has odd movement patterns, such as clumsiness or walking on toes, and has odd, stiff or exaggerated body language, Is fascinated by details of an object, such as the spinning wheels of a toy car, but doesn't understand the overall purpose or function of the object, Is unusually sensitive to light, sound or touch, yet may be indifferent to pain or temperature, Doesn't engage in imitative or make-believe play, Fixates on an object or activity with abnormal intensity or focus, Has specific food preferences, such as eating only a few foods, or refusing foods with a certain texture, As they mature, some children with autism spectrum disorder become more engaged with others and show fewer disturbances in behavior. Some, usually those with the least severe problems, eventually may lead normal or near-normal lives. Others, however, continue to have difficulty with language or social skills, and the teen years can bring worse behavioral and emotional problems.\"] \n",
      "\n",
      "mayo_causes ['Autism spectrum disorder has no single known cause. Given the complexity of the disorder, and the fact that symptoms and severity vary, there are probably many causes. Both genetics and environment may play a role. Genetics. Several different genes appear to be involved in autism spectrum disorder. For some children, autism spectrum disorder can be associated with a genetic disorder, such as Rett syndrome or fragile X syndrome. For other children, genetic changes may increase the risk of autism spectrum disorder. Still other genes may affect brain development or the way that brain cells communicate, or they may determine the severity of symptoms. Some genetic mutations seem to be inherited, while others occur spontaneously. Environmental factors. Researchers are currently exploring whether factors such as viral infections, medications or complications during pregnancy, or air pollutants play a role in triggering autism spectrum disorder. No link between vaccines and autism spectrum disorder, One of the greatest controversies in autism spectrum disorder centers on whether a link exists between the disorder and childhood vaccines. Despite extensive research, no reliable study has shown a link between autism spectrum disorder and any vaccines. In fact, the original study that ignited the debate years ago has been retracted due to poor design and questionable research methods. Avoiding childhood vaccinations can place your child and others in danger of catching and spreading serious diseases, including whooping cough, measles or mumps.'] \n",

It's not clear whether this is due to better detection and reporting or a real increase in the number of cases, or both. Autism spectrum disorder affects children of all races and nationalities, but certain factors increase a child's risk. These may include: Your child's sex. Boys are about four times more likely to develop autism spectrum disorder than girls are. Family history. Families who have one child with autism spectrum disorder have an increased risk of having another child with the disorder. It's also not uncommon for parents or relatives of a child with autism spectrum disorder to have minor problems with social or communication skills themselves or to engage in certain behaviors typical of the disorder. Other disorders. Children with certain medical conditions have a higher than normal risk of autism spectrum disorder or autism-like symptoms. Examples include fragile X syndrome, an inherited disorder that causes intellectual problems; tuberous sclerosis, a condition in which benign tumors develop in the brain; and Rett syndrome, a genetic condition occurring almost exclusively in girls, which causes slowing of head growth, intellectual disability and loss of purposeful hand use. Extremely preterm babies. Babies born before 26 weeks of gestation may have a greater risk of autism spectrum disorder. Parents' ages. There may be a connection between children born to older parents and autism spectrum disorder, but more research is necessary to establish this link.\"] \n",
